                    <p>CarePlate is on a mission to eliminate food waste while addressing hunger in communities worldwide. We connect restaurants with surplus food to NGOs that support those in need, creating an efficient redistribution system that benefits both people and the planet.</p>
                    <p>We believe that no good food should go to waste when there are people who could benefit from it. Our platform facilitates these connections to create a more sustainable and equitable food system.</p>

                    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                    <p>We envision a world where surplus food is consistently redirected to those who need it most, where restaurants minimize their environmental footprint, and where communities come together to solve the dual problems of food waste and hunger.</p>
                    <p>By 2030, we aim to help save 10 million meals annually from being wasted and redirect them to people facing food insecurity across 100 cities worldwide.</p>
